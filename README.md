# CUDA GeMM

In this project we run different cuda GeMM kernels for different matrix sizes for Benchmarks. The cuda kernels includes GeMM from cublas, cutlass and developed cuda GeMM kernels.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) is installed on your system.
- [Cutlass](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass) is cloned and placed in the main directory of the project.

Please follow the instructions provided in the respective links to install CUDA and clone the Cutlass repository.

## Installation

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd CudaGeMM
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
      ```

## Code Structure

The project is organized as follows : 
   ```bash
